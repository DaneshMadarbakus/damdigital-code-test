#DAM DIGITAL CODE TEST

##Approach: 
<li>Read through brief and viewed designs 
<li>Looked over brief again and made bullet points from background, requirements and user stories as to what was required 
<li>Put together basic HTML and CSS as per the requirement to work from as a starting point

<li>Added an event listener to the 'X's to display a modal (.modal('show')). 
<li>By binding 'this' and using .parent() I added the functionality to delete the entire objective from the modal. 
<li>I then added a checkbox to the objective divs so they could be ticked when an objective is completed and added an event listener to listen for a change on the checkbox so it could change the background color of the div accordingly.
I also thought it would be useful
